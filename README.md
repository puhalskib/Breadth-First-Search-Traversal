# Breadth-first-search
For a Lakehead University Data Structures lab assignment
# Overview
Create a tree data structure and implement a *Breadth-First Search* Algorithm.
# Implementation
A C++ implementation using classes and functions

## Class Node

**Private Variables**
```C++
vector<Node*> connections
Node* parent
char value
```
**Public Functions**
- gets and sets
---
## Class Tree
#### Private Variables
```C++
Node* root
```
#### Public Functions
- *Breadth-First Search*
- addNode()
- printTree()
# Functions of Interest
the [Breadth-First Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) can be implemented into this function easier since the data structure is a *2- way tree*
